This is an example of a full-stack [Hoplon][hoplon] application. It represents
the way that we think SPAs should be developed and deployed.

In the spirit of such things, it is a Todo application. Login is via Github
OAuth and todos are persisted on the backend.

## Development

    source local.env
    boot dev
    
Then, visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.
